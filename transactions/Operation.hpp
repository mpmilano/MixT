//Operations.
//An operation is a user-defined function which takes a number of parameters, at least one of which must be a RemoteObject pointer.
//Users aren't supposed to access raw RemoteObject pointers, so we provide a mechanism for calling these functions.

//So we want to provide a mechanism which translates the users' remote-object versions
//into our own handle-ified versions, while checking for flow violations at the parameter level.

#include "compile-time-lambda.hpp"

//because we don't have a lot of inspection abilities into this function,
//we only allow write-enabled handles into which *all* read-enabled handles are
//permitted to flow.


//Idea: you can have template<...> above this and it will work!

//later, we similarly parameterize on variadic args (basically assuming we've been

//TODO: extract_robj_p actually should worry about perfect forwarding, probably.
