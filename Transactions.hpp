			//it doesn't make a lot of sense to talk about dividing a transaction up the way andrew was talking about.
			//we've got a core problem - the way the consistency model is phrased, for two reads to be independent of each-other
			// (as in they affect different writes) and for that to therefore allow us to read at a different consistency level
			// means bad things.  Either the reads and writes are related, in which case we've just violated isolation (you have 
			// new data on the one hand and old data on the other) or your reads and writes really aren't related, in which case 
			// why are they in the same transaction?

			//moreover, the current model doesn't support this mode of thinking at all.  Sync() is a single operation - you bring
			// your _entire_ object state up to date in one fell swoop, and you additionally push your _own_ state back to the server.
			// even if they were separated, then a single high-level read would have the effect of making all subsequent reads de-facto
			// high-level.  This isn't actually going to result in the "false strong" problem - the subsequent (weaker) reads will stil
			// be _reported_ as lower-consistency, so the fact that there may be pending outstanding operations that the cache-sync didn't
			// catch is allowable under the model.

			// So the real problem here is that under the current model, the order in which you happen to read will potentially affect your 
			// correctness and performance (ie release partial transaction to master).

			// we can fix the correctness issue by de-coupling local fast-forward from master-update (not obvious how to do this, but it can be
			// done), but the performance issue still exists.  Is this really a problem? It won't affect the overall performance of a transaction,
			// after all.  
			
			// thing to look up - what's supposed to happen if you have a strong read, followed by someone else updating the value, followed by a strong
			// write?  Should the transaction abort and now be re-tried, or should it just go ahead anyway?

			//so summary - you can talk about propagating taint through a transaction to figure out which reads flow into which writes (and more importantly 
			//which reads flow into each other), and only calculate the join (meet? the makes-it-lower one) of the reads that interact.  You can trigger a 
			//sync operation only on the strong reads (there should be few of these), and while that does mean that you are partially-syncing the weak reads
			//that follow, that doesn't violate anyone's correctness or performance.  You _do_ need to de-couple client-pulls from server-pushs, so that you
			//only do the latter at the _end_ of transactions.
